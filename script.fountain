INT. SPEAKER PODIUM

Xe is standing at the podium wearing a hoodie and with the lav mic set up for local recording.

The slide shows the name of the talk and information about Xe

XE
Hi, I'm Xe Iaso and before we get started, I want to start by talking about what this talk is and is not. This talk isn't going to be the kind of high-signal AI research that I'd really love to be giving right now. This talk is about actions and consequences.

The slide shows a SammyClassicSonicFan gif.

XE
In the words of the philosopher SammyClassicSonicFan, "when will you learn that your actions have consequences?"

XE
What impacts will our ha-ha silly projects actually have on the real world where people have to take bills like this and exchange them for food and shelter?

The slide shows a blanket with water emoji on it.

XE
I'm sorry to say that this talk is going to be a bit of a wet blanket, and I'm so sorry for Yacine because 
(Ad-lib)
This talk is really about actions and consequences.

A disclaimer about not speaking for my employer.

XE
All the best things in life come with disclaimers. These words are my own. I am not speaking on behalf of my employer, past employers, or future employers should you be watching this on YouTube. I am speaking for myself and not other people.

Spoiler warning.

XE
By the way, there's massive spoilers for the Half-Life series in this talk, please be aware if you haven't played these games that are probably older than the majority of this audience.

The slide shows "About Xe" in rather large text.

XE
Before we get more into this, I think it's best that I cover information about me, what I do, and how all this AI stuff has benefitted and affected me personally.

The slide shows a picture of my blog.

XE
As Hai mentioned, I'm a somewhat avid blogger. I write for the love of writing and have potentially four megabytes of text available for anyone to learn from on my blog about a number of topics. I cover programming, spirituality, semiotics, and more. My writing is well loved by the developer community and my blog is the reason I get hired now.
(Look right at some random person in the audience)
If you're starting out in the industry, make a blog, host it yourself, makes you stand out a lot. Highly reccommend. You'll get decent enough at writing by about the 13th full length post on average.

The slide shows the ChatGPT logo.

XE
As a reward for making my blog a polished and high quality thing, it's part of the ChatGPT training dataset. Somewhere in some Azure datacenter, my blog's data is sitting there tokenized and waiting to be massaged into floating point weights by unfeeling automatons that will be used to make unimaginable amounts of money that I will never see a penny of.

The ChatGPT logo gets red and menacing.

XE
This is something that may end up haunting me for a very long time. I've thought about making a return to college to finally get a degree in linguistics, but the simple fact of the matter is that my blog is in the training set for ChatGPT, so all the poorly coded plagiarism detectors that you *know* teachers and education departments will use will permanently identify my writing style as having been written by AI. This is the punishment I get for pouring my heart, soul, and love into my craft as a blogger: I get turned into ChatGPT.

The ChatGPT logo gets uncanny.

XE
Now, the question of if this practice of taking people's random internet content and just doing whatever they want with it is without legal precedent. There's no good standard for how all this is supposed to work. This is technology that is so new it's making Bitcoin look like it's dinosaur technology from back when computers couldn't count above two-hundred fifty-six without major hacking.

Things melt further.

XE
And mind you, I'm just one blogger. I'm just one person. I don't have *that big* of a platform. For the genre of technology bloggers, sure I have a big platform, but I'm not generally "front page news" big. I'm just a person who likes talking about how I use computers and how I think they should work. I'm just a shitposter that gazed into the void too much and now the void gazes back at me.

More melting

XE
How do we understand this all? How do we figure out how to peel back the layers of terminology bullshit that prevent us from having a clear understanding of what people are even *saying*?
(Pause)
Let's start by taking the problems to a very abstract level and break things down from there.

The slide shows "You fricking fricks, when will you learn that your ACTIONS have CONSEQUENCES?" in large text, attributed to SammyClassicSonicFan.

XE
If we take all of the drama and interplay involved in our society, we can boil it down to two basic things: actions and consequences. Actions are the things that we do, consequences are the things that result.

A tree with a person cutting it down.

XE
You cut a tree down to make a fire. The animals that used that tree for shelter have a harder time finding shelter in the winter. You take an action, something or someone else has to deal with the consequences.

The slide shows the word "actions" sheltered in a house away from the word "consequences".

XE
Most of the time, our actions serve to make us better off, and shield us from the consequences those actions. We see this happen with the tree. We see this happen with ChatGPT. We will see this happen time immemorial as the rhythms of society repeat for every new generation.

The slide shows the letters "AI" in very large text.

XE
As exciting as all of this AI technology is, as a science fiction writer I can't help but see those same actions and consequences analyses for how we're using it today.

XE
Now, now, put your pitchforks down. I see you out there with them. I'm not being a contrarian here or trying to decry AI technology as wrongthink. I have a bunch of projects either in progress or planned that hard-require large language models and other AI tools in order to make them work at all.
(Pause)
I'm mostly worried about how the existing powers that be are going to take this surplus of "cheap labor" and use those actions to have massive consequences on us all.

The G-Man

XE
One of the things I want to get across here is that I'm not trying to go all "capitalism bad, bread lines for all" or something trite like that. I more want to inspire you to see what the consequences of your actions *could be*. This is made more complicated by the concept of *unforseen consequences*, or consequences that you couldn't possibly have seen coming when you were working on things.

A black swan.

XE
For a long time, people thought that swans were only pure white. Swans were used as literary symbols of pureness. People had only ever seen white swans, so the idiom of a "black swan" came into common usage as an impossible event. Then people found black swans in nature. The term "black swan event" now describes an event that is obvious in hindsight, but something that we couldn't have possibly foreseen happening at the time.

COVID-19

XE
Just like that unmentionable-on-YouTube viral pandemic that happened a few years ago that our society will never really recover from! People were warning us for years that we'd be totally screwed by a pandemic but noooo public health had to get cut!

The slide goes blank.

XE
Before we get into all of that sad stuff though, I want to reiterate one of my core points: As a tool, AI has a huge potential to be used to make humanity better. I fucked up my hands recently and I use two to three AI models to help me write things on days that I have wrist and hand pain. I use copilot to help me write boilerplate code that I don't want to have to write again and again. I use AI in ways that augment my abilities, not in ways that could serve to replace me with an unfeeling automaton.

The slide shows a ChatGPT session to generate code.

XE
Code generation is actually one of the best ways to use AI tools right now as a developer. Any good code is really the specification turned into something the computer can understand, so being able to write out the specification in plain human language and then having the machine fill in the gaps is a huge timesaver. Not to mention, code like this is super easy to statically validate. It either does what you want or it doesn't. This helps people avoid the "terror of the empty canvas" in ways that are difficult to state. As someone that wants to help create more senior programmers, this is an amazing tool to give to people.

Of course, I don't know what the downstream consequences of this will be. Giving people "cheat codes" to get to their results faster without knowing the fundamentals at play is probably not the best idea in the world in order to maintain a healthy skill balance in the workforce, but you gotta start somewhere.
