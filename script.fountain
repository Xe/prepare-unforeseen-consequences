INT. SPEAKER PODIUM

Xe is standing at the podium wearing a hoodie and with the lav mic set up for local recording.

The slide shows the name of the talk and information about Xe

XE
Hi, I'm Xe Iaso and before we get started, I want to start by talking about what this talk is and is not. This talk isn't going to be the kind of high-signal AI research that I'd really love to be giving right now. This talk is about actions and consequences.

The slide shows a picture of a Canadian $20

XE
What impacts will our ha-ha silly projects actually have on the real world where people have to take objects like this and exchange them for food and shelter?

The slide shows a blanket with water emoji on it.

XE
I'm sorry to say that this talk is going to be a bit of a wet blanket, and I'm so sorry for Yacine because 
(Ad-lib)
This talk is really about actions and consequences.

A disclaimer about not speaking for my employer.

XE
All the best things in life come with disclaimers. These words are my own. I am not speaking on behalf of my employer, past employers, or future employers should you be watching this in the future on YouTube. I am speaking for myself and not other people.

The slide shows "About Xe" in rather large text.

XE
Before we get more into this, I think it's best that I cover information about me, what I do, and how all this AI stuff has benefitted and affected me personally.

The slide shows a picture of my blog.

XE
As Hai mentioned, I'm a somewhat avid blogger. I write for the love of writing and have potentially four megabytes of text available for anyone to learn from on my blog about a number of topics. I cover programming, spirituality, semiotics, and more. My writing is well loved by the developer community and my blog is the reason I get hired now.
(Look right at some random person in the audience)
If you're starting out in the industry, make a blog, host it yourself, makes you stand out a lot. Highly reccommend. You'll get decent enough at writing by about the 13th full length post on average. This is genuine advice no matter what I say in this talk.

The slide shows the ChatGPT logo.

XE
As a reward for making my blog a polished and high quality thing, it's part of the ChatGPT training dataset. Somewhere in some Azure datacenter, my blog's data is sitting there tokenized and waiting to be massaged into floating point weights by unfeeling automatons that will be used to make unimaginable amounts of money that I will never see a penny of. This is the punishment I get for pouring my heart, soul, and love into my craft as a blogger: I get turned into ChatGPT.

The ChatGPT logo gets uncanny.

XE
Now, the question of if this practice of taking people's random internet content and just doing whatever they want with it is without legal precedent. There's no good standard for how all this is supposed to work. This is technology that is so new it's making Bitcoin look like it's dinosaur technology from back when computers couldn't count above two-hundred fifty-six without major workarounds.

Things melt further.

XE
And mind you, I'm just one blogger. I'm just one person. I don't have *that big* of a platform. For the genre of technology bloggers, sure I have a big platform, but I'm not generally "front page news on the New York Times" big. I'm just a person who likes talking about how I use computers and how I think they should work. I'm just a shitposter that gazed into the void too much and now the void gazes back at me.

More melting

XE
How do we understand this all? How do we figure out how to peel back the layers of terminology bullshit that prevent us from having a clear understanding of what people are even *saying*?

The slide shows "You fricking fricks, when will you learn that your ACTIONS have CONSEQUENCES?" in large text, attributed to SammyClassicSonicFan.

XE
If we take all of the drama and interplay involved in our society, we can boil it down to two basic things: actions and consequences. Actions are the things that we do, consequences are the things that result.

A tree with a person cutting it down.

XE
You cut a tree down to make a fire. The animals that used that tree for shelter have a harder time finding shelter in the winter. You take an action, something or someone else has to deal with the consequences.

The slide shows the word "actions" sheltered in a house away from the word "consequences".

XE
Most of the time, our actions serve to make us better off, and shield us from the consequences those actions. We see this happen with the tree. We see this happen with ChatGPT. We will see this happen time immemorial as the rhythms of society repeat for every new generation.

The slide shows the letters "AI" in very large text.

XE
As exciting as all of this AI technology is, as a science fiction writer I can't help but see those same actions and consequences analyses for how we're using it today.

The slide shows phoenix wright hold it

XE
Now, now, put your pitchforks down. I see you out there with them. I'm not being a contrarian here or trying to decry AI technology as wrongthink. I have a bunch of projects either in progress or planned that hard-require large language models and other AI tools in order to make them work at all.
(Pause)
I'm mostly worried about how the existing powers that be are going to take this surplus of "cheap labor" and use those actions to have massive consequences on us all.

The G-Man

XE
One of the things I want to get across here is that I'm not trying to go all "capitalism bad, bread lines for all" or something trite like that. I more want to inspire you to see what the consequences of your actions *could be*. This is made more complicated by the concept of *unforseen consequences*, or consequences that you couldn't possibly have seen coming when you were working on things.

A black swan.

XE
For a long time, people thought that swans were only pure white. Swans were used as literary symbols of pureness. People had only ever seen white swans, so the idiom of a "black swan" came into common usage as an impossible event. Then people found black swans in nature. The term "black swan event" now describes an event that is obvious in hindsight, but something that we couldn't have possibly foreseen happening at the time.

COVID-19

XE
Just like that unmentionable-on-YouTube viral pandemic that happened a few years ago that our society will never really recover from! People were warning us for years that we'd be totally screwed by a pandemic but noooo public health had to get cut!

The impact trifecta

XE
When anyone makes any action, there are consequences or impacts on themselves, their friends, and the world at large. I haven't found a good way to model this, but I think that triangles look cool so I made this "impact triange" to show what this all would look like.

The CS impact trifecta.

XE
Here's what I think the impact triangle for our industry looks like.

Highlight the access side.

XE
Absolutely anyone can become good at coding and then start working at or creating a company to solve a problem they have in their lives. This has allowed most of us in this room to have a start in the industry and it's allowed for uncountable amounts of upwards mobility as people use technology to make lives easier.

Highlight the certification side

XE
There's no professional certification required to practice our profession. We don't need to be licensed to be computer scientists, and basically anyone can have an impact on the world scale if they get lucky.

Highlight the limits side

XE
Our industry measures results in small terms. In aggregate, we only care about how the things we do today will make the capitalism line go up for the next quarter. There's no ethical or professional guidelines that prevent people from making "bad" things, the sheer force of the market is intended to weed all that out.

Show the triangle as a whole.

XE
For most other professions in the job market, this trifecta of factors makes our industry look reckless. In order to be an accountant, you have to be licensed to be an accountant and you have ethical guidelines that if you violate, you lose your license to be an accountant. To be a surgeon, you need to have an educational background in surgery and a medical license to practice it. No such barriers to entry exist with our profession.

Facebook logo.

XE
Facebook has one billion users. Billion with a "b". Nine significant figures. The goal of Facebook when it was created was to make us all a little bit closer. The thought was that by reducing the social distance between us all, we could make everyone better off.

A slide full of the number 9

XE
An unimaginable amount of photos, video, and text posts are made to Facebook every day. Some fraction of those violate Facebook's content guidelines at the least and are fully illegal at most. Many trivial cases can be handled by their machine learning algorithms, but there's always the exceptional bit that need to be judged by a human.

Facebook content moderators.

XE
Content moderation is impossible at small scales. The level of impossibility grows as the scale grows. I'm almost certain that it's actually impossible to moderate Facebook posts with humans at this point, but they try regardless and like any venture-backed company they farmed it out for someone else to deal with the consequences. Those contractors subcontract that out so that they don't have to deal with the consequences of that. And finally, it all ends up in the desks of people that are tortured by the things that they are forced to witness because if they don't stop witnessing it, they can't make rent.

The Zucc

XE
For the action of creating Facebook, he gets to make a bunker on hawaii, raising his own cattle for slaughter and making beer by himself. He does not have to see the images that the content moderators are forced to see. He just lays back and watches his bank account number go up.

Go back to the triangle.

XE
Because the only limit is what makes the line go up, the human cost is totally discounted from the equation. The people doing the actions don't see the consequences. The CEO of Uber never lost his job as a taxi driver because Uber drives did his job for cheaper. The CEO of Google never has suffered the algorithm deciding he's a criminal and locking him out of his digital life. The people doing the actions are not affected by any unforeseen consequences of those actions.

Automuse

XE
The last time I spoke here, I spoke about a work of satire: Automuse. Automuse is a tool that uses large language models to recreate the normal novel writing process using stochastic randomness and tools like Plotto. I just wanted to see what could happen.

You're winner

XE
To my horror, I won the hackathon. With a *shitpost* about the publishing industry that was inspired by my fear of what could happen if things like this were more widespread.

Blank

XE
When I gave my talk at the hackathon, there was a part of it that I left out. I'm not sure why I left it out, it just "felt right" at the time. That part I left out was inspired by this quote from SammyClassicSonicFan:

SammyClassicSonicFan quote

XE
When will you **learn**? When will you learn that your **actions** have **consequences**?
(Pause)
I made Automuse precisely because I understand how impractical it is. The output quality of Automuse will simply never compare to the output quality of skilled human writers making original, high quality writing.
(Pause)
Sure, yes, there's a rather large market for low-quality pleasure reading that something like Automuse could fill. There's a rather large number of people that enjoy rather formulaic things about good winning out over evil, or romance novels that make people feel young again, or whatever. Not to mention, doing something like that would leave me an excellent moat because most AI companies try to focus on high quality output, meaning that lower quality stuff is laughed off as a waste of time.

Crutch

XE
When I made Automuse, I intentionally crippled it so that it would be difficult for anyone to use. Even me. I made it so that it requires a private dependency that I have access to but nobody else would. I made the tool in such a way that it requires massive human intervention in order to work. Whenever people ask me how to set it up for themselves, I quote absurd figures to them and they're always surprised and angry that a person making open source software would want to be paid for their time.

Friends

XE
I don't want automuse to displace the effort of my friends.
(Long pause)

Amazon Kindle

XE
Above all, the reason I haven't worked to productize it or make it available in mass consumption form is that I don't want my product to make the problem of book spam worse. The AI-generated book spam problem is bad enough that Amazon has had to institute uploading limits to the Kindle store for the first time ever. I don't think I could live with myself if something I made and released made the problem worse.

Spellblade cover

XE
It's bad enough that whenever I get around to finishing my novel Spellblade, I'm almost certainly going to release it to my patrons and/or for very cheap on itch.io. I don't want something I make to be drowned out by the mountains of cheaply made books uploaded to Amazon on an hourly basis.

OpenAI logo

XE
I don't think that anyone at OpenAI anticipated that people would use ChatGPT to make algorithmic book spam worse. I have a friend that works there and generally I think OpenAI is actually approaching things from the right ideological stance...

Dollar signs

XE
Except when it comes to getting that sweet sweet return on investment from making the most powerful AI tools in the world available to the public by charging them for the output.

A robot painting a flower.

XE
The part that really confuses me is why we're automating away art and writing before automating away actually harmful things. There's a really subtle part of this that makes me concerned for the future of our industry and I think we all need to be aware of it before it comes to bite us.

A historical photo of an assembly line.

XE
With the industrial revolution came the factories. Factories allowed us to produce objects on scales that we had never dreamed of before. Raw materials and people go in on one end, finished products come out on the other end. This has allowed us to become the kind of species we are today. In less than 100 hours, you can circumnavigate the globe. You can head to an entirely different continent in 12 hours. This has also lead to discoveries that have made us healthier, live longer, and overall been a boon for the human race in aggregate.

People in a factory working next to machines.

XE
However, look again at this and you'll see another thing at play. These jobs that used to be done extensively by humans are now starting to be done by unfeeling automatons. With every new model year, there's more automation at play and less room for human jobs. Sure, we can make more cars, but every job that's done by a robot is a job that can't make a family thrive. It's another house that can't make rent. It's another way for the ownership class to scrape more off of the top.
(Pause)
With this in mind, I want you to consider this:
(Snap fingers)

An open office with people working.

XE
In our modern world, how is this open office really that different from a factory in most cases? Instead of wool or wood as input, we have user stories, electricity, and coffee. Many of companies we work at are merely just assembly lines for code or kubernetes configurations. I think the ultimate dream of this lies in the idea of the T-shaped developer that I've seen many management people talk about:

The t-shaped developer.

XE
With a T-shaped developer, the basic idea is that you have core competency in one field, and enough broad knowledge in other fields that you can be put just about anywhere in the company and be productive. This is why you see things like ephemeral teams or decrees from on high that everything must be written in JavaScript from here on out. This makes it easier to move people around and place them wherever the company needs.

A boot.

XE
Not to mention, easier to get people off of the street and have them be competent at the job in days so that you don't have to spend the months requisite to train new people to do their job. Ever noticed that every job opportunity these days is for senior roles only? This is why. Usually by the time you convince companies to give you a senior title, you're already molded into a T-shaped developer and can slot in just about anywhere. 

The open office again.

XE
This is our assembly line, created in the fear that if we don't do this, the wrong line will trend the wrong way and then investors won't give out money as freely.

Clock emoji.

XE
That being said, I think that it's going to be a while until we can get to the point where AI tools can totally replace our jobs. Right now there isn't a magic button that product teams can use to "just implement the feature" instantly. I think it'll be a long ways off and probably requires us to find a better architecture than attention-window transformer models.

Blank

XE
However, there is a segment of people that can already be replaced by the magic "just implement it" button today.

"Artists"

XE
Artists. Stable Diffusion, MidJourney, and Dall-E 3 have all gotten to the point that the output is good enough to publish as-is. For the vast majority of people, as long as there's nothing wrong with the hands, they won't be able to tell that an image is AI-generated.

Go back to that robot painting flowers picture.

XE
However, people can **tell** when you made an AI illustration. The stem on this flower is crooked in ways that flowers just don't work. The brush at the bottom of this image blends into the easel. The robot parts are melting a bit. The flower the robot is holding is also inconsistent, making it look like the flower is both forwards and backwards. It looks passable at first glance, but the moment you start looking at this critically it falls to pieces.
(Pause)
I guess the better question here is "why would you want to use an ai-generated image in something?"

The picture of that one blogpost telling people to use cover images

XE
Because we've come to expect that blogposts need to have cover images, and there's more desire for people to have cheap filler art than there are artists willing to work for unrealistically low prices. Art is everywhere to the point that it's commoditized and the perceived value of it is next to zero while rent and food prices keep going up. So we end up with something like this:

The art assembly line of robots painting flowers.

XE
You get an assembly line of robots painting flowers.
(Pause)
This is why I didn't want to develop Automuse into a company. That action would have too many consequences that I don't want my friends and fellow artists to suffer. This is why I did so much detailed math about how much it would cost per word, how the quality would be seen in the market, and what impacts such a thing could have if it churned out hundreds of books per hour.

The art of shitposting.

XE
When I made Automuse, I made it as a joke because of how terrible of an idea it would be. I know it can't write better than a human can. You know that it can't write better than a human can. I just wanted to put the parts together and see what the results looked like. It was a shitpost, pure and simple.
(Pause)
And it won.

Surplus of cheap labor.

XE
One way to look at the rise of these AI tools is that it's a surplus of cheap labor. Cheap labor that allows for easily customizing the outputs. Cheap labor that gets back a result instantly. Cheap labor that can't get sick. Cheap labor that doesn't have kids and need to take months off for maternity leave. Cheap labor that can do the job good enough.

Boot emoji.

XE
Cheap labor that is able to displace human labor in an economy built around unsustainable infinite growth.

Happy angel emoji

XE
Outside of the systems we live in, yeah, AI stuff is great. It's fantastic tech that allows us to do any number of things that we couldn't do before.

Uncanny sad angel.

XE
But inside these systems we live in, I can't help but see this as yet another way of human labor being displaced.

Engineering

XE
And yet we wonder why people in our industry can't call ourselves "engineers" in Ontario. Do we really engineer anything or are we just tools of the capitalism line to make the capitalism line go up?

SammyClassicSonicFan quote

XE
When will we **LEARN** that our **ACTIONS** have **CONSEQUENCES**?
(Long pause)

The G-Man.

XE
Until then,
(Uncanny, pause inhumanly)
Prepare for unforeseen consequences.

The GReeTZ slide.

XE
Thank you all for watching this and I hope that it gives you some things to think about. I hope I didn't break too many taboos about our industry in the process, but who am I kidding, I probably broke a lot of them. Please thank everyone on this list for inspiring me to take action and pushing me towards the presentation I gave tonight. Special thanks to Mystes and Layl for really grinding hard into this, ripping it in half, and telling me when I'm full of shit. Extra special thanks to my husband for coming out here to record this for me.

End slide.

XE
And thank you for watching! This was a pretty heavy talk. It may take you a while to surface questions about it. If you have them right now, ask away, but if it takes you time to come up with them, please email me at unforeseen consequences at xeserv dot us.
(Pause)
Does anyone have any questions?
