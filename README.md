# Prepare for Unforeseen Consequences

This is a git repo that lets you see the writing and rewriting process that I did in order to make my talk "Prepare for Unforeseen Consequences" at the Ottawa chapter of AI Tinkerers a reality. The script is in `script.fountain` and each commit has the contents of the talk draft at that snapshot in time.

I've also included the bibliography in BibTeX format.
